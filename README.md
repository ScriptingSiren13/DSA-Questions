I am a beginner coder, committed to daily practice and documenting my progress. Currently, I'm diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python, following the insightful DSA crack sheet by the renowned YouTuber 'Love Babbar'. While my learning journey is diverse, I rely on resources like GeeksforGeeks, various YouTube channels, and even ChatGPT for guidance and clarification. Excited for the coding adventures ahead!
